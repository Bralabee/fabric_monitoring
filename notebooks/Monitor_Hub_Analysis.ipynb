    "# Monitor Hub Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook executes the **Monitor Hub Analysis Pipeline**, which is designed to provide deep insights into Microsoft Fabric activity. It extracts historical data, calculates key performance metrics, and generates comprehensive reports to help identify:\n",
    "- Constant failures and reliability issues.\n",
    "- Excess activity by users, locations, or domains.\n",
    "- Historical performance trends over the last 90 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features & Recent Updates (v0.1.14)\n",
    "The pipeline has been enhanced to support enterprise-grade monitoring workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **CSV-Based Analysis (v0.1.14)**:\n",
    "    -   **Source of Truth**: The notebook now loads data from the generated `activities_master_*.csv` reports.\n",
    "    -   **Benefit**: Ensures consistent analysis using the same data that is exported to stakeholders, avoiding format discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Strict Authentication (v0.1.13)**:\n",
    "    -   **Problem**: Previous versions would silently fall back to a restricted identity if the Service Principal login failed.\n",
    "    -   **Solution**: The system now raises an immediate error if configured credentials fail, forcing you to fix the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Smart Scope Detection (v0.1.12)**:\n",
    "    -   **Primary Strategy**: Attempts to use Power BI Admin APIs for full **Tenant-Wide** visibility.\n",
    "    -   **Automatic Fallback**: If Admin permissions are missing (401/403), it gracefully reverts to **Member-Only** mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Automatic Persistence & Path Resolution**:\n",
    "    -   **Automatic Lakehouse Resolution**: Relative paths (e.g., `exports/`) are automatically mapped to `/lakehouse/default/Files/` in Fabric.\n",
    "    -   **Sequential Orchestration**: Handles the entire data lifecycle (Activity Extraction -> Job Detail Extraction -> Merging -> Analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "1. **Install Package**: The first cell installs the `usf_fabric_monitoring` package into the current session.\n",
    "2. **Configure Credentials**: Ensure your Service Principal credentials (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`) are available.\n",
    "3. **Set Parameters**:\n",
    "    - `DAYS_TO_ANALYZE`: Number of days of history to fetch (default: 90).\n",
    "    - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path where reports will be saved (can now be relative!).\n",
    "4. **Run Analysis**: Execute the pipeline cell. It will:\n",
    "    - Fetch data from Fabric APIs.\n",
    "    - Process and enrich the data.\n",
    "    - Save CSV reports and Parquet files to the specified `OUTPUT_DIR`."
