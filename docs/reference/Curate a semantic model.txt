Curate a semantic model and power bi report to visually represent the data consumed from the activity monitor in STRY0019806.

Whilst this should not be a direct replicable of the on premise Subscription History, it should draw inspiration from it to provide insights into the below:

- Activities
- Failed Activity
- Success %
- Total Duration (if possible)

The above should be visualised by:

Domain > Workspace
User
Day > Hour

In addition to the above key metrics, there should also be visibility of Activities that are consistently failing - at present this we highlight anything that has not completed successfully in the last 7 days.

Purpose of the reporting insights is to help manage user activity and take action against users / domains that having constantly failing activity, effectivity consuming resource for no purpose.

Acceptance criteria
Report is produced to provide necessary insight into the require use cases to help manage the activity load within fabric - with focus on the failed activity. We expect to be able to determine the, as a minimum the below insights:


Which Domain has the most failed activities
Which Workspace has the most failed activities
Which user "owns" the most failed activities
Which Domain has the most activities / longest aggregate duration of activities
Which Domain has the most activities / longest aggregate duration of activities
Which User has the most activities / longest aggregate duration of activities
Which activities are constantly failing with no success
Which activities have the worst success rate
